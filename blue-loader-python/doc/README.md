# BOLOS Python Tools Documentation

The latest version of this repository can be viewed, pre-built, here:
https://ledger.readthedocs.io/projects/blue-loader-python.

## Building

If you wish, you may install Sphinx and build this documentation into a
collection of HTML files yourself.

Firstly, make sure you have [pip
installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Secondly, install Sphinx and the Read the Docs theme:

```
pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
```

Finally, build:

```
make html
```

You will need internet access for intersphinx to work properly.
